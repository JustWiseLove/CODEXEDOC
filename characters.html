A wealthy man with a church meeting in his home, Philemon showed generosity by supporting Paul’s ministry, even while Paul was imprisoned. When Onesimus, who had fled after wronging Philemon, met Paul and became a believer, Paul wrote a letter urging Philemon to receive him not as a slave but as a beloved brother, offering to repay any debt. Philemon’s willingness to follow this counsel reflected his trust in Jehovah’s principles of love and reconciliation.
