                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>To accept Bible truth, your personality matters. Some resist because they’ve been indoctrinated with lies for years. Jehovah seeks those with the right traits to break free and learn. What are they?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Are you hungry for truth?</strong> A deep desire to know Jehovah drives you to seek His Word over human traditions.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled. — Matthew 5:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you honest with yourself?</strong> Facing the truth means admitting you might have been misled—hard, but vital for growth.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit. — Proverbs 12:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you humble enough to change?</strong> Pride blocks learning; humility opens your heart to Jehovah’s correction.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones. — James 4:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you open-minded to new ideas?</strong> Overcoming indoctrination requires examining the Bible without prejudice.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>They accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily. — Acts 17:11</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Do you have courage to stand apart?</strong> Truth often means rejecting popular lies—courage keeps you firm.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you. — Joshua 1:9</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These traits—hunger, honesty, humility, open-mindedness, and courage—equip you to see past a lifetime of lies and embrace Jehovah’s truth!</p>

                <details class="item">
                    <summary class="item-button">Are You Ready For The Truth?</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Have you ever believed in “heat lightning” as a unique phenomenon, only to learn it’s just distant lightning reflecting off clouds? Or that swallowing gum stays in your stomach for years? These are common misconceptions we accept until we seek the truth. Life is full of similar falsehoods—about God, purpose, and the world. Are you ready to admit you’ve been misled and discover Jehovah’s truth through His Word?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Do you question what you’ve been told?</strong> Like believing “bats are blind,” many cling to false ideas. A curious heart seeks Jehovah’s truth beyond myths.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Test all things; hold fast to what is fine. — 1 Thessalonians 5:21</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Can you admit you might be wrong?</strong> It’s humbling to realize you’ve believed lies, like “cracking knuckles causes arthritis.” Honesty opens the door to Bible truth.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit. — Proverbs 12:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you eager to learn Jehovah’s view?</strong> Just as “the heart has four chambers” is a fact, God’s Word reveals undeniable truths about life and worship.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Your word is truth. — John 17:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Will you let go of popular beliefs?</strong> Many hold onto ideas like “lightning never strikes twice,” yet truth often challenges tradition. Jehovah’s wisdom surpasses human ideas.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding. — Proverbs 3:5</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Do you have the courage to stand for truth?</strong> Rejecting falsehoods, like “goldfish have a three-second memory,” takes boldness. Living by Jehovah’s truth sets you apart.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you. — Joshua 1:9</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Questioning myths, admitting error, seeking Jehovah’s Word, rejecting false traditions, and standing boldly—these qualities help you break free from life’s lies and embrace the truth found in the Bible!</p>
