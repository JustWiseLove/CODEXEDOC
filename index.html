                        <p>To accept Bible truth, your personality matters. Some resist because they’ve been indoctrinated with lies for years. Jehovah seeks those with the right traits to break free and learn. What are they?</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Are you hungry for truth?</strong> A deep desire to know Jehovah drives you to seek His Word over human traditions.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled. — Matthew 5:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you honest with yourself?</strong> Facing the truth means admitting you might have been misled—hard, but vital for growth.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit. — Proverbs 12:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you humble enough to change?</strong> Pride blocks learning; humility opens your heart to Jehovah’s correction.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones. — James 4:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you open-minded to new ideas?</strong> Overcoming indoctrination requires examining the Bible without prejudice.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>They accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily. — Acts 17:11</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Do you have courage to stand apart?</strong> Truth often means rejecting popular lies—courage keeps you firm.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you. — Joshua 1:9</em></p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>These traits—hunger, honesty, humility, open-mindedness, and courage—equip you to see past a lifetime of lies and embrace Jehovah’s truth!</p>

                        <p>Truth from Jehovah’s Word is a precious gift, but accepting it requires a heart prepared to act. Are you ready to let the Bible guide your life? Consider these qualities that show readiness for truth.</p>
                        <ol>
